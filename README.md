VHDL, which stands for VHSIC Hardware Description Language which also is an acronym for Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language, is a programming language used to describe digital circuits and systems. It was developed in the 1980s by the U.S. Department of Defense as a standard for designing digital systems. VHDL is widely used in the field of electronic design automation (EDA) and is an essential tool for designing complex digital systems. VHDL and Verilog are the two languages digital designers use to describe their circuits, and they are different by design than your traditional software languages such as C and Java. VHDL and Verilog are used by education and business to design FPGAs and ASICs.
